## About me + Guessing Game
I built a website that tells the user about myself. My website asks questions about me. The purpose of this website is to practice making a website with seperate HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. I used loops and arrays in JavaScript to create my question prompts.

### Reflections and Comments
This project challenged me to keep my HTML, CSS and JavaScript work separate. In the middle of working on HTML I would jump over to CSS because I didn't like a margin or a color. I had to force myself to compartmentalize each component of the site to really get a good work flow going. It really makes sense why you would finish the HTML before moving to the CSS and JavaScript now. Of course you float around a little bit naturally but you really don't know what your CSS needs to  look like before your HTML is complete and so on. This project also made it clear how much time you can sink into CSS if you're not careful. 
### Lab 3 Revision Comments
I ended up spending about an hour trying to figure out why my loop wouldn't iterate more than once only for it to be a rogue semicolon! The first loops I used for the too low/too high question were pretty simple. When I got to the multiple correct array question the loop got more complex. I started by just making if and else if statements until a classmate pointed out that wasn't going to work of my array got really big. I got to appreciate the power of a nested loop. Now my multiple correct question can be changed to any number of correct answers and still work. This lap took me five and a half hours to complete.
