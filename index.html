      <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I worked as a Manufacturing Engineer before I joined the world of software development. I am a father of 4. My eldest is 16 and I adopted her when she was 5. My two main hobbies are Moutnain Biking and Magic the Gathering (card game). I attended DeVry back in 2006 for game design but left the program early. I didn't complete my engineering degree until 2015. I was laid off in March 2020 due to COVID-19. I had already been considering a career change due to slow career growth and high turnover in the manufacturing engineering feild.

      <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal is to become a back end web developer. I want this career so that I can be deeply involved in the root-cause problem solving process. I find the web development toolbox very satisfying and engaging to work with. I hope to join the tech industry so I can have the option to work from home and no longer be exposed to the unstable job market in manufacturing.</p>
